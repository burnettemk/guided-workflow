Consider switching from calling start.bat to opening a subprocess with shell=True in start.py

Write 'create workspace' code
- setup prompts
- parse input
- write code as a 'procedure' i.e. think of it as a procedure that can be transferred and translated
    (will be used in the future for creating a window)

Create directory 'workspaces' and add associated .bat or .cmd files for prompts
